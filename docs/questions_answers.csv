what is a valid offer?,"Basically, an offer is an indication in words or by conduct by an offeror that he or she is prepared to be bound by a contract in the terms expressed in the offer, if the offeree communicates to the offeror his or her acceptance of those terms. Accordingly, the offer has to be definite and final and must not leave significant terms open for further negotiation. By significant, we here mean terms that are essential to the bargain contemplated. It is important to emphasise the proposition that the mere acceptance of an offer is sufficient to turn the offer into a contract, if there is consideration for it, together with an intention to create legal relations. It is this need for finality and definiteness which leads to the analytical need for the concept of invitation to treat.",1.503011,"{""booksReferredTo"": [], ""caseId"": {""number"": ""J4/12/2008"", ""type"": ""CIVIL APPEAL""}, ""casesReferredTo"": [], ""combinedCounsel"": [""COUNSEL"", ""BRIGHT OKYERE-AGYEKU FOR THE APPELLANT"", ""DOE TSIKATA FOR THE APPELLANT""], ""combinedParties"": [""YAA ANTWI - PLAINTIFF/APPELLANT/RESPONDENT"", ""VRS"", ""N.T.H.C. - DEFENDANT/RESPONDENT/APPELLANT""], ""counsel"": {""Plaintiff/Appellant"": [""BRIGHT OKYERE-AGYEKU"", ""DOE TSIKATA""], ""Defendant/Respondent"": []}, ""court"": {""name"": ""SUPREME COURT"", ""location"": {""country"": ""GHANA"", ""city"": ""ACCRA \u2013 GHANA""}}, ""editorialNote"": null, ""headNotes"": null, ""indices"": [], ""judgement"": {""date"": ""2009-02-04T00:00:00.000Z"", ""year"": 2009, ""month"": ""February"", ""day"": 4}, ""judges"": [], ""lawReportsCitations"": [], ""mediaNeutralCitation"": ""[2009] GHASC 5"", ""natureOfProceedings"": null, ""partiesOfSuit"": {""Plaintiff/Appellant"": [""YAA ANTWI""], ""Defendant/Respondent"": [""N.T.H.C""]}, ""presidingJudge"": ""Akuffo, JSC"", ""source"": ""ghalii.org"", ""sourceFile"": ""\\original_source_files\\Courts-20230120T154617Z-001\\Courts\\Supreme court\\2009\\5.html"", ""statutesReferredTo"": [], ""title"": {""long"": ""YAA ANTWI vs N.T.H.C"", ""short"": ""Antwi vs N.T.H.C""}}","c.The Court of Appeal erred when it ordered Appellant to refund to Respondent all rents paid by the Respondent to Appellant. d.Further and/or in the alternative the Court of Appeal erred when it retrospectively decreed specific performance of the contract without awarding Plaintiff interest on the purchase price of $70,307.00” Before resolving the issue of interpretation raised in ground (a), however, it would be useful to remind ourselves, in outline, of the principles to be applied in distinguishing between offers and invitations to treat.

Again applying the test as to acceptance, the offer of the plaintiff was not rejected by the defendant, neither was there a counter offer nor a demand or clarification for further information. Ex ‘EE’ was clear, in in its acceptance as it provided the purchase price per share, the amount of shares being accepted for the sale etc. If this cannot constitute acceptance of an offer, then what else can constitute acceptance.
