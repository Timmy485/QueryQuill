What case defines what an offer is?,"It is important to emphasise the proposition that the mere acceptance of an offer is sufficient to turn the offer into a contract, if there is consideration for it, together with an intention to create legal relations. It is this need for finality and definiteness which leads to the analytical need for the concept of invitation to treat. If a communication during negotiations is not the final expression of an alleged offeror’s willingness to be bound, it may be interpreted as an invitation to the other party to use it as a basis for formulating a proposal emanating from him or her that is definite enough to qualify as an offer. Thus the indefinite communication may be what generates an offer from the other side. An invitation to treat is thus to be distinguished from an offer on the basis of the proposal’s lack of an essential characteristic of an offer, namely, its finality which gives a capacity to the offeree to transform the offer into a contract by the mere communication of his or her assent to its terms.",1.5268584,"{""booksReferredTo"": [], ""caseId"": {""number"": ""J4/12/2008"", ""type"": ""CIVIL APPEAL""}, ""casesReferredTo"": [], ""combinedCounsel"": [""BRIGHT OKYERE-AGYEKU FOR THE APPELLANT"", ""DOE TSIKATA FOR THE APPELLANT""], ""combinedParties"": [""YAA ANTWI  VRS  N.T.H.C.""], ""counsel"": {""Plaintiff/Appellant"": [""BRIGHT OKYERE-AGYEKU""], ""Defendant/Respondent"": [""DOE TSIKATA""]}, ""court"": {""location"": {""city"": ""ACCRA  GHANA"", ""country"": ""GHANA""}, ""name"": ""SUPREME COURT""}, ""editorialNote"": null, ""headNotes"": null, ""indices"": [], ""judgement"": {""date"": ""2009-02-04T00:00:00.000Z"", ""year"": 2009, ""month"": ""February"", ""day"": 4}, ""judges"": [], ""lawReportsCitations"": [], ""mediaNeutralCitation"": null, ""natureOfProceedings"": null, ""partiesOfSuit"": {""Plaintiff/Appellant"": [""YAA ANTWI""], ""Defendant/Respondent"": [""N.T.H.C.""]}, ""presidingJudge"": ""ADINYIRA, (MRS)"", ""source"": ""elibrary.jsg.gov.gh"", ""sourceFile"": ""\\original_source_files\\Courts-20230120T154617Z-001\\Courts\\Supreme court\\2009\\YAA ANTWI  VRS  N.T.H.C..htm"", ""statutesReferredTo"": [], ""title"": {""long"": ""YAA ANTWI  VRS  N.T.H.C."", ""short"": ""YAA ANTWI vs N.T.H.C.""}}",No,"If a communication during negotiations is not the final expression of an alleged offeror’s willingness to be bound, it may be interpreted as an invitation to the other party to use it as a basis for formulating a proposal emanating from him or her that is definite enough to qualify as an offer.

She therefore instituted an action for damages. She founded her claim on the negligence of the driver and also the vicarious liability of the second defendant, his employer. The plaintiff sought to establish negligence first by legal and necessary implication from the effect of the interlocutory judgment obtained against the driver on his default to plead and secondly by invoking the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur. The second defendant did not dispute the negligence of its driver, but sought to repudiate liability on the grounds that (1) the plaintiff was a trespasser on the bank's car; (2) the driver was acting outside the scope of his employment when he took the plaintiff as a passenger on the bank's vehicle; (3) the driver was not acting in the course of his employment because he had deviated from his route.

Can the liability of a subsidiary company be extended to a parent company,"439, C.A. where after the business had been converted into a private company the agreement provided that the company should fulfil existing contracts as agents of the seller. Where there is no such agreement it is a question of fact in each case whether the subsidiary company is carrying on the parent company's business or its own. In this regard I think all the circumstances must be taken into account the following being particularly relevant: (1) Are the profits treated as those of the parent company? (2) Are the persons conducting the business appointed by the parent company? (3) Is the parent company the head and brain of the enterprise? (4) Does the parent company govern the business and decide what should be done and what capital should be employed? (5) Are the profits made by its skill and direction ? (6) Is the parent company in effectual control? From the evidence of the plaintiff�s third witness, the personnel manager of Prestea Goldfields Ltd., and that of the plaintiff�s fourth witness, the Chief Inspector of Mines, there is no doubt that all these questions ought to be answered in the affirmative.

And if so, why should the 2nddefendant be permitted to keep the benefit of its breach, by enjoying the services rendered by the plaintiffs whiles the plaintiffs suffer from an alleged breach by being denied payment for the works done by them at the promptings of the 2nd defendant? Where is the equity and good conscience in such a step? In the opinion of the court it would be unfair, unjust, inequitable, and unconscionable to deprive the plaintiffs of their remuneration. It seems to the court that the defendant had in mind the Public Procurement Act, 2003 Act 663, which sets out in part six, sections 66 to 77, the methods and procedures to be followed before the services of Consultants were engaged by agencies and departments of Government. It ought however to be pointed out that Act 663 received Presidential assent after the contract, subject of this suit, had been entered and for that matter this Act does not operate retrospectively to regulate the contract, subject matter of this suit. Another issue which engaged the attention of the defendants at the trial was the amount being claimed by the plaintiffs. The defendants had, in effect, argued that the fee payable to the plaintiffs, being the consideration for the works done, was not known at the time the parties entered the agreement and so there was no contract upon which the plaintiffs could sue.",1.4789423,"{""booksReferredTo"": [], ""caseId"": {""number"": ""RPC/03/2012"", ""type"": ""SUIT""}, ""casesReferredTo"": [], ""combinedCounsel"": [""MS.

can you repeat an injunction application in the same court,"Being an application for injunction, Rule 31 of CI 19 gives this court general power to deal with the application, rule 28 allows this court to deal with a repeat application from the high court, and section 12(b) of the Courts Act allows the court to vary, discharge or reverse an order for injunction made by a single Judge of the court of appeal. In the instant case, the application was first submitted to the high court, and repeated in the court of appeal. At the court of appeal, it was dealt with by a single judge and granted, subject to conditions. It is because the order of the single judge lapsed after 10 days owing to the non-fulfillment of the conditions attached to it that this court was disabled from examining on merit whether it is just and convenient for the court to vary, discharge, reverse or affirm the original grant by the single Judge.

the effect of failure to correct an error apparent on the face of the record of appeal,"Where there are evidence that the facts were not properly discussed and if they are properly discussed and evaluated the errors to be corrected, may overturn the judgment, the appeal should succeed. On the other hand, where the errors are corrected and would not disturb the judgment, the appeal should fail. Where a court is setting aside a judgment, on the premise that the judgment is against the evidence on record, the court must satisfy itself that the mistakes to be corrected arising from the improper evaluation of the facts should be a genuine one and not fanciful errors. In the case in point the Appellant’s concern is that the trial Judge held that an employer who terminates the employee’s employment is not required to assign reason but where he assigns reasons he should be able to justify it.
